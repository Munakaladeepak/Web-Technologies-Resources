            <p style="font-size:30px; ">What is the <strong>Web Technology</strong> ?</p>
            <p align="justify ">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet World Wide Web or an intranet a private network. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications,
                electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
                scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals, "Web development " usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development
                may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow
                standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information
                systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and
                full-stack developer.Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing
                the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

            <h1>Some of programming languages in Web Development</h1>
            <h2>HTML(HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
            <p align="justify ">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
                web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive
                forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated
                by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and p surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
                display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
            <p align="justify "> Cascading style sheets is used to style the webpage by using the selector like class,id,Html elements. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such
                as HTML CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve
                the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen,
                in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

            </p>
            <br>



            <h2>Java Script(Js) </h2>
            <p align="justify ">
                Java script is an scripting language which is used to make an static webpage in to an dynamical webpage or an responsive webpage and perform the action like taking the input and and processing the data and then giving the output to the user.It makes the
                webpage as the user interactive webpage JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
                often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
                (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            </p>


            <h2>JQUERY </h2>
            <p align="justify ">
                jQuery is a JavaScript framework designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, 
                CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of Aug 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 
                10 million most popular websites. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at 
                least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.
                jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, 
                select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. 
                jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. 
                This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, 
                theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
            </p>

            <h2>Angular JS </h2>
            <p align="justify ">
                AngularJS is a discontinued free and open-source JavaScript-based web framework for developing single-page applications. It was maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. It aimed to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.

                AngularJS was used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, that consisted of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment.
                
                As of January 1, 2022, Google no longer updates AngularJS to fix security, browser compatibility, or jQuery issues. The Angular team recommends upgrading to Angular (v2+) as the best path forward, but they also provided some other options.
                The AngularJS framework worked by first reading the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page, which had additional custom HTML attributes embedded into it. Angular interpreted those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables could be manually set within the code or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.
                            
            </p>

            
            <h2>SQL</h2>
            <p align="justify ">
                Structured query language (SQL) is a popular query language that is frequently used in all types of applications. Data analysts and developers learn and use SQL because it integrates well with different programming languages. For example, they can embed SQL queries with the Java programming language to build high-performing data processing applications with major SQL database systems such as Oracle or MS SQL Server. SQL is also fairly easy to learn as it uses common English keywords in its statements

            </p>

            <h2>PHP</h2>
            <p align="justify ">
                PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
                PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
               
PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.

It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.
PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.

PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
PHP Syntax is C-Like.
