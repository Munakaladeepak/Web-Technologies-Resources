    <h3> WEB SERVER AND SERVER SIDE SCRIPTING USING PHP</h3>

A web server is a program that delivers web pages to clients upon request. It receives HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from web clients such as web browsers and returns responses containing HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents, images, and other media files. The most common web server software is Apache HTTP Server, but there are many others available.
<BR><BR>
Server-side scripting is a technique that allows web developers to generate dynamic content by running scripts on the web server. In contrast to client-side scripting (such as JavaScript), which runs on the user's browser, server-side scripting is executed on the server before the content is sent to the client.
<BR><BR>
PHP is a popular server-side scripting language that is widely used for creating dynamic web pages. PHP scripts can be embedded within HTML pages or used to generate entire pages on the fly. PHP can interact with databases, handle user input, and perform various server-side tasks.
<BR><BR>
To use PHP on a web server, you need to have a web server installed that supports PHP. Apache HTTP Server is a common choice, and it can be configured to work with PHP using a module called mod_php. Other web servers, such as Nginx or Microsoft IIS, can also be configured to work with PHP.

A web server is a computer system that serves websites to clients over the internet. The architecture of a web server typically consists of several layers, each of which performs a specific function:
<BR><BR><BR>
  <b>  1.Hardware layer: </b>  The hardware layer consists of the physical computer hardware that hosts the web server. This includes the server computer, the network infrastructure, and any storage devices that are used to store website data.
<BR><BR>
  <b>  2.Operating system layer:</b>  The operating system (OS) layer provides the software interface between the hardware and the web server software. Popular operating systems for web servers include Linux, Windows, and macOS.
<BR><BR>
   <b>3.Web server software layer: </b>  The web server software layer is responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests from clients and returning HTTP responses with the requested data. Popular web server software includes Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.
<BR><BR>
     <b>  4.Application layer:</b>   The application layer includes any software applications that run on the web server, such as content management systems, e-commerce platforms, or custom web applications.
<BR><BR>
  <b>5.Database layer: </b>  The database layer provides storage and retrieval of data for web applications. Common databases used by web servers include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
<BR><BR>
  <b>6.Security layer: </b>  The security layer includes various measures to protect the web server and its data from unauthorized access or attack. This can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and SSL/TLS encryption.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer data over the web. It defines a set of methods that are used to request and send data between web servers and clients.
<BR><BR>
The main HTTP request types are:
<BR><BR>
  <b> GET:</b>  The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. This method is used when you want to retrieve information, such as a web page or an image, from the server.
<BR><BR>
  <B> POST:</B>  The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. This method is used when you want to create or update data on the server, such as submitting a form.
<BR><BR>
  <B> PUT:</B> The PUT method is used to update a resource on the server. This method is used when you want to modify or update an existing resource, such as a file or a document.
<BR><BR>
    <B> DELETE:</B> The DELETE method is used to delete a resource on the server. This method is used when you want to remove a resource from the server.
<BR><BR>
  <B> HEAD:</B>  The HEAD method is similar to GET, but it only retrieves the header information for a resource. This method is used when you want to check if a resource exists, without actually retrieving the resource content.
<BR><BR>
  <B> OPTIONS:</B>  The OPTIONS method is used to retrieve the supported methods and other options for a resource. This method is used when you want to determine the available methods for a resource.
<BR><BR>
 <B> CONNECT:</B>  The CONNECT method is used to establish a network connection to a resource. This method is used when you want to establish a secure connection, such as when using HTTPS.
<BR><BR>
  <B> TRACE:</B>  The TRACE method is used to retrieve a diagnostic trace of the requests and responses between a client and a server. This method is used for debugging purposes
<BR><BR>

IIS (Internet Information Services) and Apache are two popular web servers used for hosting websites and web applications. While they both serve the same purpose, there are some key differences between the two in terms of their properties and features.
<BR><BR><BR>
 <B>1.Platform support: </B>  IIS is a web server developed by Microsoft and is only available for Windows operating systems, whereas Apache is open-source and can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
<BR><BR>
  <b> 2.Configuration: </b>  IIS uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuration, while Apache uses configuration files that are edited manually. This makes IIS easier to configure for users who are less familiar with command-line interfaces.
<BR><BR>
 <b>3.Performance: </b>  Apache is known for its high performance and stability, and is often preferred by developers who need to handle high volumes of traffic. IIS has also improved significantly in recent years and can handle a large number of requests, but some users still report that it is slower than Apache.
<BR><BR>
  <b>  4.Security:</b>  Both IIS and Apache have a good reputation for security, but IIS has traditionally been considered more secure due to its tight integration with the Windows operating system. However, the security of any web server ultimately depends on how well it is configured and maintained by the user.
<BR><BR>
   <b>5. Extensibility:  </b>  Apache has a large library of modules that can be used to extend its functionality, while IIS has fewer third-party modules available. However, IIS has a more integrated ecosystem with other Microsoft technologies, such as ASP.NET, that can make it a more attractive option for Windows-based applications.

HTML and PHP can be easily combined to create dynamic web pages that can display data from databases, generate dynamic content, and perform various other functions.
<BR><BR><BR>
Here are the steps to combine HTML and PHP:
<BR><BR>
    <b>1.Create a new PHP file: </b> Create a new PHP file and save it with the .php extension. For example, you can save the file as "index.php".
<BR><BR>
   <b> 2.Add HTML code: </b>  Add your HTML code to the PHP file. You can use the same HTML code that you would use in a regular HTML file.
<BR><BR>
     <b>  3.Embed PHP code: </b> To embed PHP code into your HTML, use the opening and closing PHP tags - <?php and ?>. You can then add your PHP code between these tags.
<BR><BR>
 <b>4.Display PHP variables: </b> To display PHP variables in your HTML, simply echo the variable using the echo function. For example, if you have a variable called $name, you can display it in your HTML using <?php echo $name; ?>.
<BR><BR>
  <b> 5.Run the PHP file:</b>  Save your PHP file and run it on your web server. You should see your HTML code, along with any PHP variables or functions that you have embedded into it.

To access HTML and PHP documents from a web server, you need to follow these steps:
<BR><BR><BR>
    <b> step 1</b><br>
First, you need to make sure that your HTML and PHP files are stored in the correct directory on your web server. Typically, web server providers have a public_html or htdocs directory where all website files are stored.
<BR><BR>
        <b> step 2</b><br>
Once you have confirmed the correct location of your files, you need to use an FTP client (such as FileZilla) to transfer your HTML and PHP files to the web server. You will need to provide your FTP credentials to connect to the server and upload your files.
<BR><BR>
    <b> step 3</b><br>
Once your files have been uploaded, you can access them by typing the URL of your website in a web browser. For example, if your website is named "example.com", you would type "http://example.com" into your browser's address bar.
<BR><BR>
    <b> step 4</b><br>
If your HTML and PHP files are stored in a subdirectory on the web server (for example, if they are stored in a folder named "mywebsite"), you would need to type the URL of that subdirectory in the browser's address bar. For example, "http://example.com/mywebsite".
<BR><BR>
    <b> step 5</b><br>
If you have set up your website using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress or Drupal, you may need to log in to the CMS's admin panel to access your HTML and PHP files. This will depend on the specific CMS you are using and how it is configured.

There are many different data types used in programming and computer science. Here are some of the most common data types with examples:
<BR><BR><BR>
 <b>Integer: </b>  An integer is a whole number with no fractional component. For example: 1, 2, -3, 0.
<BR><BR>
 <b>Floating-point number: </b>  A floating-point number is a number with a fractional component. It can be represented in scientific notation. For example: 3.14, -2.5, 1.0.<BR><BR>

 <b>Boolean: </b> A Boolean data type is used to represent true/false values. For example: true, false.<BR><BR>

 <b> String:</b>  A string is a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, enclosed in quotation marks. For example: "hello", "123", "!@#".
<BR><BR>
 <b>Character: </b>  A character is a single symbol or letter. For example: 'a', '1', '@'.
<BR><BR>
    <b>Array: </b>  An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. For example, an array of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
<BR><BR>
  <b>Object: </b> An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where the values can be of any data type. For example: { "name": "John", "age": 30 }.
<BR><BR>
  <b> Null:</b>  Null is a special value that represents no value or no data. For example, when a variable is declared but not assigned a value.
<BR><BR>
  <b>Undefined: </b>  Undefined is a value that represents a variable that has been declared but not defined or initialized.

In computer programming, variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated, while constants are used to store data values that cannot be modified during the execution of the program. The method to declare variables and constants depends on the programming language being used.
<BR><BR>
Here are some general guidelines:
<BR>
<H3>1.Declaring variables:
</H3>
In most programming languages, variables can be declared by specifying the variable name, data type, and initial value (if any). For example, in Python, you can declare a variable as follows:
<BR><b>
age = 25<BR>
</b>
Here, "age" is the variable name, "int" is the data type (which stands for integer), and "25" is the initial value assigned to the variable.
<BR><BR>
<H3>2.Declaring constants:
</H3>
In most programming languages, constants can be declared using the "const" keyword or by specifying the "final" or "readonly" modifiers. For example, in Java, you can declare a constant as follows:
<BR><b> 
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;</b><br>
Here, "MAX_VALUE" is the constant name, "final" is the modifier that makes it a constant, "int" is the data type, and "100" is the value assigned to the constant.

                                An array is a data structure used to store a collection of values, all of the same type, in a contiguous block of memory. The values in an array are called elements and can be accessed using an index or a subscript.
                                <BR><BR>
                                Arrays are used in programming to store and manipulate data in an organized and efficient way. They are often used to represent lists, tables, or matrices. Arrays can be declared with a fixed size, or they can be dynamically resized during runtime.<BR><BR><BR>
                                
                                For example, in JavaScript, you can create an array like this:
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b>let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; </b> 
                                <BR><BR>
                                In this example, fruits is an array that contains three elements. You can access the elements of the array using their index, like this:<BR>
                                 <b> console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"<BR>
                                console.log(fruits[1]); // "banana"<BR>
                                console.log(fruits[2]); // "orange"<BR></b>
                                
                                


                                        
                             
                               
                                </p>

                                In computer programming, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Arrays can be classified into several types based on different criteria. Here are some of the most common types of arrays:
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b>One-dimensional array: </b>  This is the simplest type of array, where data elements are arranged in a linear fashion, represented by a single row or column. It is also called a vector or a linear array.
                                <BR><BR>
                                   <b>  Multi-dimensional array: </b>  This type of array stores data in more than one dimension. A two-dimensional array can be represented by a matrix or a table, with rows and columns. Similarly, a three-dimensional array can be represented as a cube with multiple layers.
                                <BR><BR>
                                   <b> Fixed-size array:</b>  In this type of array, the size of the array is predefined and cannot be changed during runtime. This is also called a static array.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b> Dynamic array:</b>  This type of array can change its size dynamically during runtime. The size of the array can be increased or decreased based on the program's requirements. Examples of dynamic arrays include ArrayList in Java and Vector in C++.<BR><BR>
                                
                                 <b>Associative array: </b>  This type of array stores data in key-value pairs, where each element is associated with a unique key. It is also called a map or a dictionary.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b> Jagged array:</b>  In this type of array, the size of each row can be different. It is also called a ragged array or an array of arrays. It is commonly used to represent a two-dimensional array where each row can have a different number of columns

                                In web development, forms are used to collect user input data and send it to a server for further processing. PHP provides two superglobal arrays, $_GET and $_POST, to handle form data.
                                <BR><BR><BR>
                               <H3>1.$_GET method:
                                </H3>
                                The $_GET method is used to retrieve data that is sent through the URL query string. It appends data to the URL after a question mark (?) and is usually used for non-sensitive data. For example, a search form might use the $_GET method to send the search query to the server.
                                <BR><BR>
                                To retrieve form data using the $_GET method, you can use the following code:<BR>
                                 <b> if (isset($_GET['submit'])) {<BR>
                                    $name = $_GET['name'];<BR>
                                    $email = $_GET['email'];<BR>
                                    // Do something with the form data<BR>
                                }<BR><BR>
                                </b>
                                Here, isset($_GET['submit']) checks if the form has been submitted using a submit button with the name "submit". If the submit button has been clicked, the values entered in the form are retrieved using $_GET['name'] and $_GET['email'].
                                <BR><BR>
                                <H3>2.$_POST method:
                                </H3><BR>
                                The $_POST method is used to retrieve data that is sent through an HTML form using the HTTP POST method. It is commonly used to send sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, etc. The data is sent in the HTTP request body and is not visible in the URL.<BR>
                                   <b>  if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {<BR>
                                    $name = $_POST['name'];<BR>
                                    $email = $_POST['email'];<BR>
                                    // Do something with the form data<BR>
                                }<BR>
                                </b>
                                <BR>
                                To retrieve form data using the $_POST method, you can use the following code:
                                Here, isset($_POST['submit']) checks if the form has been submitted using a submit button with the name "submit". If the submit button has been clicked, the values entered in the form are retrieved using $_POST['name'] and $_POST['email']

                                MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used in PHP programming. PHP provides several built-in functions that allow programmers to interact with MySQL databases efficiently. Here are some of the most commonly used MySQL database functions in PHP:
                                <BR><BR><BR>
                                <b>  mysqli_connect(): T </b>   This function creates a new connection to a MySQL database. It takes four parameters - host, username, password, and database name - and returns a connection object.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b>mysqli_query(): </b>  This function executes a SQL query on the database. It takes two parameters - the connection object and the SQL query string - and returns a result object.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b>mysqli_fetch_assoc(): </b>  This function retrieves a row from the result set returned by a query and returns it as an associative array. It takes a result object as a parameter.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b>mysqli_num_rows(): </b>  This function returns the number of rows in the result set returned by a query. It takes a result object as a parameter.
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b>  mysqli_real_escape_string():</b>  This function escapes special characters in a string to prevent SQL injection attacks. It takes two parameters - the connection object and the string to be escaped - and returns the escaped string.
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b>mysqli_error():  </b>This function returns the last error message from the MySQL database. It takes a connection object as a parameter.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b> mysqli_close(): </b>  This function closes the connection to the MySQL database. It takes a connection object as a parameter.

                                Connecting to a database involves several steps, which are typically executed in a specific order. The following is a general outline of the steps involved in connecting to a database:
                                <BR><br>
                                <b>1.Determine the database type: </b>   Before you can connect to a database, you need to know the type of database you are working with, such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or MongoDB.
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b> 2.Install the database software:</b>  If you haven't already, you will need to install the database software on your computer or server. This step may involve downloading the software from the vendor's website, running an installer program, and configuring the software to run on your system.
                                <BR><BR>
                                   <b>3.Create a database: </b>  Once the software is installed, you will typically need to create a new database within the software. This step may involve running a command in a command prompt or using a graphical user interface provided by the software.
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b> 4.Obtain connection details: </b>  To connect to the database, you will need to obtain the connection details, such as the database name, host name, port number, and login credentials. These details will be specific to your database software and installation.
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b>5.Choose a programming language: </b>  You will need to choose a programming language that is compatible with your database software. Popular options include Java, Python, PHP, and C#.
                                <BR><BR>
                                  <b> 6.Install a database driver:  </b> To connect to the database from your programming language, you will need to install a database driver. A database driver is a software component that allows your programming language to communicate with the database software.
                                <BR><BR>
                                 <b>7. Write code to connect to the database: </b> Using your chosen programming language, you will need to write code to connect to the database. This code will typically involve creating a connection object and passing in the connection details obtained in step 4.

                                Retrieving data from a table is a basic operation in relational databases. Here are the steps to retrieve data from a table:
                                <BR><BR><BR>
                                1.Determine the table from which you want to retrieve data.
                                <BR><BR>
                                2.Write a SQL SELECT statement that specifies the columns you want to retrieve and the table from which you want to retrieve the data.
                                <BR><BR>
                                3.Optional: Add a WHERE clause to filter the data based on certain criteria. For example, if you only want to retrieve rows where a specific column has a certain value, you can add a WHERE clause to your SELECT statement.
                                <BR><BR>
                                4.Execute the SELECT statement.
                                <BR><BR>
                                Here's an example of a basic SELECT statement to retrieve all columns from a table called "employees":
                                SELECT * FROM employees;
                                <BR><BR>
                                This will retrieve all rows and columns from the "employees" table. If you only want to retrieve specific columns, you can list them out instead of using the asterisk:
                                <BR><BR>
                                <b>SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM employees; </b> 
                                <BR><BR>
                                If you want to add a WHERE clause to filter the data, you can do something like this:<BR>
                                 <b>  SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'; </b>
                            
                              
                                
                                        
                             
                               
                                </p>

                                Inserting data into a table is the process of adding new records or rows to a table in a database. This can be done using SQL, which is a standard language for managing relational databases.<BR>
                                <BR>
                                To insert data into a table, you need to use the INSERT INTO statement, which specifies the table name and the values to be inserted. The syntax of the statement is as follows:<BR><BR>
                                <b>
                                INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)<BR>
                                VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);<BR><BR>
                                </b>
                                Here, table_name is the name of the table you want to insert data into, and column1, column2, column3, etc. are the names of the columns in the table. The VALUES keyword is used to specify the values to be inserted, which correspond to the columns in the order they are listed.
                                <BR><BR>
                                For example, let's say you have a table called "customers" with columns for "customer_id", "first_name", "last_name", "email", and "phone". To insert a new customer record into the table, you might use the following SQL statement:
                                <BR><BR><b>
                                INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email, phone)<BR>
                                VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@email.com', '555-1234');<BR><BR>
                                </b>
                                This would insert a new row into the "customers" table with the values 'John' for the first_name column, 'Doe' for the last_name column, 'johndoe@email.com' for the email column, and '555-1234' for the phone column.
                                <BR><BR>
                                It's important to make sure that the values you are inserting match the data types of the columns in the table, and that any required columns are included in the INSERT statement.
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                        
                             
                               
                                </p>

                                To update data in a table, you can use the SQL UPDATE statement. The syntax for the UPDATE statement is as follows:
                                <BR><BR>
                                UPDATE table_name<BR>

                                WHERE condition;<BR>
                                Here's a breakdown of what each part of the statement does:<BR><BR>
                                
                                UPDATE table_name specifies the name of the table you want to update.
                                SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... sets the values of the columns you want to update to the specified values.
                                <BR><BR>
                                WHERE condition specifies the rows you want to update based on some condition. If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be updated with the new values.<BR><BR>
                                
                                For example, suppose you have a table called students with columns id, name, age, and grade. To update the age of the student with ID 1 to 20, you could use the following SQL statement.<BR><BR>
                                  <b>
                                UPDATE students<BR>
                                SET age = 20<BR>
                                WHERE id = 1;<BR><BR>
                                </b>
                                This would update the age of the student with ID 1 to 20. If you wanted to update multiple columns, you could separate them with commas in the SET clause:
                                



                                        
                             
                               
                                </p>

                                <H3>1.Creating a Cookie:</H3>
                                To create a cookie, use the document.cookie property to set the cookie value along with any optional parameters like the expiration date, path, domain, and secure flag. Here's an example:
                                <BR>
                                
                                 <b> document.cookie = "myCookieName=myCookieValue; expires=Thu, 14 Apr 2023 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";</b> 
                                <BR>
                                
                                In this example, the cookie name is "myCookieName" and the value is "myCookieValue". The "expires" parameter specifies the expiration date and time of the cookie. The "path" parameter sets the path on the server where the cookie is valid. The slash (/) means the cookie is valid for all pages on the website. Finally, the cookie is set by assigning the string to the document.cookie property.
                                
                                <BR><BR>
                                <H3>2.Deleting a Cookie:</H3>
                                To delete a cookie, set the expiration date to a time in the past. Here's an example:<BR>
                                
                                  <b> document.cookie = "myCookieName=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/";</b> 
                                <BR><BR>
                                In this example, the cookie name is "myCookieName" and the value is empty. The "expires" parameter is set to a time in the past, which will cause the cookie to be immediately deleted. The "path" parameter is set to the same value as when the cookie was created.
                                <BR><BR>
                                Note that deleting a cookie only removes it from the client-side browser. It does not remove the cookie from the server, so it is important to ensure that the server no longer uses the cookie.

                                It's important to note that session_destroy() only destroys the data associated with the current session. If you want to destroy all sessions on the server, you can call session_unset() to clear the session data, and then session_regenerate_id(true) to generate a new session ID, effectively destroying all sessions on the server

                                It's also worth noting that you should call session_start() before calling session_destroy() or any other session-related function, to ensure that you're working with the correct session.

                                Sessions are an important feature of PHP that allows the server to store user-specific data across multiple requests. They are used to maintain state information between HTTP requests, such as user authentication, shopping cart contents, and other user-specific information.
                                <br><br>
                                The server then stores information associated with that session ID in its memory or in a storage medium like a database. This information can be retrieved and updated as the user interacts with the website.

There are several ways to pass data from one web page to another web page, depending on your specific requirements and the tools and technologies you are using. Here are some common methods:<BR><BR>

  <B> 1.Query string parameters:</B>  One of the simplest ways to pass data between web pages is through query string parameters. You can append data to the URL of the target page as key-value pairs, separated by "&" symbols. For example, if you want to pass the username "john" to the next page, you can add it to the URL like this: http://www.example.com/nextpage.html?username=john. The target page can then read this data from the query string using JavaScript or server-side programming languages.
<BR><BR>

 <B> 2.HTML form submission:</B>  If you have a form on the source page that collects data from the user, you can submit that form to the target page using the HTTP POST or GET method. When the target page receives the form data, it can process it and use it as needed. The form data can be accessed using server-side programming languages such as PHP, ASP.NET, or Java servlets.
<BR><BR>
  <B> 3.Cookies: </B> Another way to pass data between web pages is through cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's browser and can be accessed by any web page that shares the same domain. You can set a cookie on the source page and read it on the target page to transfer data between them. However, cookies have some limitations, such as size limits and security concerns.
<BR><BR>
    <B>4.Session variables: </B>  If you need to pass data between multiple pages within the same web application, you can use session variables. Session variables are variables that are stored on the server and are accessible across multiple pages during a user's session. You can set a session variable on the source page and read it on the target page to transfer data between them. Session variables are commonly used in server-side programming languages such as PHP, ASP.NET, or Java servlets.
<BR><BR>
  <B> 5.Local Storage: </B> Local storage is another way to store data on the client-side. This method allows you to store data persistently on the user's browser and access it on any page that shares the same domain. You can use JavaScript to set and retrieve data from local storage. However, local storage also has some limitations, such as size limits and lack of cross-domain access.
